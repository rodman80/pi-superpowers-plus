# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

If a tool result contains a ⚠️ workflow warning, stop immediately and address it before continuing.

## Boundaries
- Run verification commands: yes
- Read code and output: yes
- Edit source code: no

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!", etc.)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports without checking outputs
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- **ANY wording implying success without fresh evidence**

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
✅ Run tests + confirm 0 failures before saying "tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**
```
✅ Verify red → green sequence before claiming fix durability
❌ "I added a regression test" (without proving red-green)
```

**Build:**
```
✅ Run build command + confirm exit 0
❌ "Linter passed" (linter ≠ build)
```

**Requirements:**
```
✅ Check requirements one-by-one, report verified status
❌ "Tests pass, so everything is complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**
```
✅ Verify agent output + diffs + commands yourself
❌ Trust "agent says success"
```

## Enforcement

The workflow-monitor extension gates `git commit`, `git push`, and `gh pr create`. If you haven't run a passing test suite since your last source file edit, the command gets a warning injected into its tool result. The gate clears automatically after a fresh passing test run.
