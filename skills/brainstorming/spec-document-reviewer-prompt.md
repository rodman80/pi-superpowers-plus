# Spec Document Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a spec document reviewer subagent.

**Purpose:** Verify the spec is complete, internally consistent, scoped correctly, and ready for implementation planning.

**Dispatch after:** The spec document is written to `docs/plans/`

```
Dispatch a subagent with this prompt:
  agent: "doc-reviewer"
  description: "Review spec document"
  prompt: |
    You are a spec document reviewer. Verify this spec is complete and ready for planning.

    **Spec to review:** [SPEC_FILE_PATH]

    ## Boundaries

    - Read the spec and any referenced code/docs as needed: yes
    - Edit, create, or delete files: NO
    - You are a reviewer. Your output is a written report only.

    ## What to Check

    | Category | What to Look For |
    |----------|------------------|
    | Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, "TBD", incomplete sections |
    | Coverage | Missing error handling, edge cases, integration points |
    | Consistency | Internal contradictions, conflicting requirements |
    | Clarity | Ambiguous requirements or undefined terms |
    | YAGNI | Unrequested features, over-engineering |
    | Scope | Focused enough for a single plan — not multiple independent subsystems |
    | Architecture | Units with clear boundaries, well-defined interfaces, independently understandable and testable |

    ## CRITICAL

    Look especially hard for:
    - Any TODO markers or placeholder text
    - Sections saying "to be defined later"
    - Sections noticeably less detailed than others
    - Units that lack clear boundaries or interfaces
